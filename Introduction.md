The best neighboorhood is one that supports families, nature, and everything in between. 
Through the use of datasets measuuring the amount of respctive parks, playgrounds, fields, and greenways in different neighborhoods, we will determine which
neigherhood best represents these qualities.
The metric is defined as natural and familial livabillity, and whichever neighboorhood has the most total from each of the datasets will be crowned the best.
