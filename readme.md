### Focus: Green living in Pittsburgh
We chose to focus our analysis of Pittsburgh's best neighborhood on the number of greenspaces in a given community. As can be seen in our choice of datasets below, our final notebook covers several different types of greenspaces available in Pittsburgh and uses a weighted system to decide which neighborhood is the best. More information is included in the FinalNotebook.ipynb.

### Datasets used: 
1. City of Pittsburgh Playgrounds(https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/playgrounds): data on playgrounds in different Pittsburgh nerighborhoods
2. City of Pittsburgh Parks(https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/parks): data on parks in different Pittsburgh nerighborhoods
3. City of Pittsburgh Playing Fields(https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/playing-fields): data on playing fields in different Pittsburgh nerighborhoods
4. City of Pittsburgh Greenways(https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/greenways): data on greenways in different Pittsburgh nerighborhoods

Our respository features each individual's notebook and our combined notebook. Nathan covered the greenways and fields, while Adam covered 
parks, and Scott covered playgrounds.
